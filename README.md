## Top 10 Blockchain Networks For Developers

### Ethereum ![Ethereum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErikThiart/cryptocurrency-icons/master/16/ethereum.png "Ethereum (ETH)")

 <details>
<summary>About It</summary>
<br>

 [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) published by [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?s=20&t=WPTZffsZfzb9bAiPYVBtDw)
 
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.

Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum‚Äôs price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum‚Äôs price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.
 
### About Founders

Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders ‚Äî an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.

- Russian-Canadian [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?s=20&t=WPTZffsZfzb9bAiPYVBtDw) is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.
- British programmer [Gavin Wood](https://twitter.com/gavofyork?s=20&t=mU7mHJq5HFbGD_m_rGgXyA) is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum‚Äôs native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.

### How Ethereum Is Unique?

Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.

 - [Polygon Whitepaper](https://github.com/maticnetwork/whitepaper)
 
 Polygon (previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and  infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.
 
 Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains.
 
 MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem. The transaction fees on Polygon sidechains are also paid in MATIC tokens.

### SOLANA ![Solana](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErikThiart/cryptocurrency-icons/master/16/solana.png "Solana (SOL)")

 <details>
<summary>About It</summary>
<br>
 
 - [Solana Whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)
 
Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology‚Äôs permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.
 
 ### About Founder
 
 [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.

In 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.
